# Exploring Playability Dimensions in Video Games

Here is the implementation code for my research project titled "Exploring Playability Dimensions in Video Games: NLP-Powered Analysis of User Reviews and Regression Modeling."

The raw data is stored at the following link:

Due to limitations in computing power on personal devices, I have segmented the original data into several files for separate processing. The naming convention in the code, such as "part1" and "part2," reflects this segmentation. If you intend to replicate the study, please adjust the operations according to your specific circumstances.

Thank you very much.
